#Search-Engine

#Introduction

This project is designed to provide a practical understanding of search engines and web crawling. It allows users to perform searches and view their search history. The search functionality is complex, involving various algorithms and techniques.

The core of this project is to retrieve the top 30 search results based on a user's query, simulating the functionality of a real search engine. It also maintains a history of user searches, which can be useful for analysis and personalization.

#Features
